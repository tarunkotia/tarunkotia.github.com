I run because,   
with every stride I take, I feel closer to the earth,   
with every breath I take, I consume the skies above me,  
with every inch, every foot, every mile I leave behind, it comes back to become part of my life   
with every passing day running has consumed me and before I realized it has become a way of my life.
