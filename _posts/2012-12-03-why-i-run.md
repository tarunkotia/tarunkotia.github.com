### Why I Run?

I run because with every stride brings me closer to the earth, 
with every breath I take, I consume the skies above me,  
with every inch, every foot, every mile I leave behind, it comes back to become part of my life. 
With every passing day running has consumed me and before I realized it has become a way of my life.
